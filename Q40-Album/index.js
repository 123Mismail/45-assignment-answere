//Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.

// Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three
// dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects
// are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() 
//that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a 
//value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
