//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function
// should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary
// number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other 
// name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
//Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly
